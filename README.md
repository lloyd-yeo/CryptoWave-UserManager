## Work Flow
1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Create a new branch, please don't work in your `master` branch directly in the future.
3. If you have a large change in mind, it is still preferred that you split them into small commits.  Good commit messages are important.  The git documentatproject has some nice guidelines on [writing descriptive commit messages](http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html#Commit-Guidelines).
4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
